== Organizer Tips

  When installing the virtual environment be sure:
    * not to call the .ova file the same name as the shared folder
    * create in the terminal and verify it's in the shared folder
    * make sure the internet is working but pinging with 
      'curl -I http://www.rubyweekend.com'

== Rules of Thumb
  * Name tags are friendly
  * 1 Volunteers per 5 attendees
  * Announce and event 4-6 weeks before the date
  * 1 Speaker, 1 Driver

== For Drivers
  * Only type what the presenter says to type
  * Helps offer less errors
  * Makes the speaker say everything out loud
  * AirPlay is not reliable, have a wired option ready

== For Organizers
  * Be at the event at least 30 minutes before the time on the agenda
  * Be mindful of your volunteers time, it's very valuable.
  * Only trusted members should volunteer
    * They will represent @LVRUG
    * Participating in Ruby Weekend in a privilege
  * Be sure to offer a short (10 questions) survey at the end of the weekend.
